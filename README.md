</h1>


The goal of this theme is to provide a smooth experience and maintain attractive colors, even when **Night Mode** *(yellow light filter)* is turned on, whether on desktop or mobile.

## Special Thanks

I drew inspiration from [Monokai](https://github.com/tzcl/logseq-monokai) and [Ros√© Pine](https://github.com/ebarruel/logseq-rose-pine-theme) while developing the Elysium theme. Much appreciation to their amazing work!
